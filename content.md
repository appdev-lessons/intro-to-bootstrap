# Intro to Bootstrap

<div class="bg-blue-100 py-1 px-5" markdown="1">

[Here is a video for this lesson](https://share.descript.com/view/MmodIxr2YZq). When you are done with the Bootstrap Levels project, you should have a look a the [Design Resources lesson](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/143-design-resources), and if you want more practice with Bootstrap, then visit the [Bootstrapping Bulletin Board lesson](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/138-bootstrap-bulletin-board-1).

## Setup

There are no automated tests in this project, so you should fork the bootstrap-levels repository:

[github.com/appdev-projects/bootstrap-levels/fork](https://github.com/appdev-projects/bootstrap-levels/fork) 

directly and set up a codespace as usual.

## Getting started

When you visit your live app preview after running `bin/dev`, you will be greeted by a table of contents. You can click the first link to get started:

There, you will see a set of clear instructions with links to read more on the Bootstrap official documents. At the bottom of the page are instructions to open another window of the live app preview, along with the location of the view template for you to modify to style that new page.

When you are done with the styling, click the button on the bottom of the page to head to the next exercise.

Proceed like so through all of the levels, and have fun!

(P.S. You can View Source on the targets when you get stuck!)
