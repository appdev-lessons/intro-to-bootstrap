# Intro to Bootstrap

## Setup

There are no automated tests in this project, so you should [fork the bootstrap-levels repository](https://github.com/appdev-projects/bootstrap-levels/fork) directly and set up a codespace as usual.

Then:

- `bin/dev`
- Look around the live app preview and the codebase. 
- There are some instructions on the homepage of the app.
- You can View Source on the targets when you get stuck.
